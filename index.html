    <h2>What is fudge?</h2>
    <p>Fudge is a type of delicious, delicious dessert. I personally have never tasted fudge before, but I have once sampled
        Banana-Fudge ice cream,</p>
    <p>and have since then fell in love with it. Unfortunately, there are no Fudge stores around me, but
    I will be getting some soon! ;)</p>
    
    <p>Fudge is a dessert where you mix chocolate and other ingredients and heat it up to 300c. </p>
