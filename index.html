    <h2>What is fudge?</h2>
    <p>Fudge is a type of delicious, delicious dessert. I personally have never tasted fudge before, but I have once sampled
        Banana-Fudge ice cream,</p>
    <p>and have since then fell in love with it. Unfortunately, there are no Fudge stores around me, but
    I will be getting some soon! ;)</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>Fudge is a dessert where you mix chocolate and other ingredients and heat it up to 114c. This will</p>
    <p>produce a hot, thick liquid, which after it cools down, turns hard and can be cut into squares. Chocolate is</p>
    <p>one of the primary and most classical flavours, but there are others as well, such as Tiger fluff, peanut butter, vanilla and maple!</p>

    <h2>A breif history of fudge!</h2>
    <img src="History of fudge.png" alt="More fudge!">
    <p>The term "fudge" means "cobbled together" or "to fit together in a clumsy manner".</p>
    <p>Originating from the 17th century, It was used as slang back then by sailors</p>
    <p>to respond to untruth or nonsense.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>The actual desert was created in the late 19th century, somewhere in the 1880s. The</p>
    <p>story goes that a batch of caramels were "fudged"- made incorrectly- and resulted in a more</p>
    <p>soft, creamy, chewy texture that was different from other desserts at the time. </p>
    <p>The first documented creation of fudge was in the 1880s, where a student at a local girls</p>
    <p>university somehow got ahold of the recipie and made 30 pounds of it, which was sold at an auction.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>it's distinct texture and flavour, as well as It's inexpensive and simpleness, as it was made</p>
    <p>with only 3-4 ingredients, captivated people who looked for cheap, affordable and simple candy</p>
    <p>that they can make at home themselves. Specialised fudge shops opened in tourist hotspots, and</p>
    <p>the price of sugar was decreasing at that time, furthur spreading it's popularity. Soon, the creation</p>
    <p>spread worldwide, with people experimenting with new flavours, which lead to the sweet, delicious dessert</p>
    <p>we have today!</p>
